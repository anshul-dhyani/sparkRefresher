2.1 Create a RDD of integers from 1 to 100 using Scala or Python and show 10 records from this rdd.
2.2 Create a dataframe from RDD of assignment 2.1 and then
        a) printSchema of the dataframe
        b) show  10 lines of this dataframe
2.3 For RDD created in assignment 2.1,
        a) apply ‘map’ transformation over this RDD to square each number and save it to a file.
        b) apply filter on RDD created in step a) above,  to get RDD having  values greater than 1000
2.4 Convert RDD of assignment 2.1 to a Dataframe and save it as parquet file
