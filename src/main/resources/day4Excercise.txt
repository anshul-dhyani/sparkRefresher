4.1
    a) Create a RDD or DF out of integers from 1 to 1000 and have these in 3 partitions.  Print the number of partitions
    b)
        1) Create a DF out of below records (pass schema too)
        2) Use groupBy to get sum of salaries citywise and print in a console or save in paraquet file
        3) Print the plan of the dataframe or RDD, preferably use DF. Check for line indicating shuffle. Note - ‘exchange’ in plan indicates shuffle.
        4) Check the number of stages for this on Spark UI.
